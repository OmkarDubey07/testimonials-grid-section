                    the free Intro course and found It Incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.The next 12
                    weeks was the best and most grueling-time of my life.Since completing the course,I've
                    successfully switched careers,working asaSoftware Engineer ataVR startup."

                <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
                <p>"Before joining the bootcamp ,I've
                    never written a line of code. I needed
                    some structure from professionals
                    who can help me learn programming
                    step by step. I was encouraged to
                    enroll by a former student of theirs
                    who can only say wonderful things
                    about the program.The entire
                    curriculum and staff did not
                    disappoint.They were very hands-on
                    and I never had to wait long for
                    assistance.The agile team project,In
                    particular,was outstanding.It took
                    my learning to the next level in away
                    that no tutorial could ever have.In
                    fact,I've often referred to it during
                    Interviews as an example of my
                    development experience.It certainly
                    helped me land a job as a full-stack
                    developer after receiving multiple
                    offers.100%recommend!"</p>
